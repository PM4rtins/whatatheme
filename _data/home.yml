      This digital space was crafted with - you - the visitor, in mind.<br><br>

        &nbsp;❱ A vehicle for my vision, creative and lateral thought processes, things which 
        stubbornly refuse to fit within the pages of a standard résumé. <br><br>

        &nbsp;❱ Incidentally it serves as an exposé into "How I think about what I think.", a place as 
        beautiful and inspiring as I managed to make it.<br><br>

      Feel free to browse. I hope you enjoy<br><br><br>
