        In this entry, I explore the relationships between Capitalism, Information and 
        Society through an historical lense and try to make sense of why 
        attempts at directed economies have failed in the past, why they might succeed 
        in the future and how society at large can't will them into existence.

quote: |
  The young man who does not grow up feeling the love of the village will 
  eventually burn it down to feel its warmth.

I used to read a lot more books when I was a child. Now it's not so much that I
don't find the time for them. But more so, that entertainment has seeped into 
every other vacant second of my existence.
<br><br>
Back then, one would have a task and finish it, and the act of entertaining one
self enjoyed a certain degree of separation. Now however, if I feel the need for
some joyous abtraction I can very easily check my cell-phone for 5 to 50 minutes
and consider my self entertained.
<br><br>
This isn't a rant about cellphones however, this was about the books I read and
how they shaped my world view. At this point 1984 and Brave New World are cliché
enough that they for the most part dismiss a thorough explanation.
<br><br>
But in extremely coarse terms the first is a pseudo-love story taking place in a 
dystopian socialist totalitarian regime that employs mass surveilence and mass 
reeducation on its people, and the other is a dystopian neo-liberal world 
governed by a strict cast system enforced via eugenics.
<br><br>
In my psique these two books created a sort of spectrum, not so much because they
are perfectly anti-thetical, but rather because they are two points one can draw
a line through, and infer where the natural poles for human governance in the
future might lie.
