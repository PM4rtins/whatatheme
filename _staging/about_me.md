## Breaking it down:

This space has a few themed sections:

    - “Academia” profile presents, with rigor, my academic persona, fields of study, and achievements.
    - “Portfolio” showcases my favorite projects and sometimes goes in depth into the thought processes behind them.
    - “Analytics” section is where I showcase interesting data analyses of certain phenomena, focusing not only on techniques but also on interpretation.
    - Lastly, the “Journal” is where I post my personal thoughts about Artificial Intelligence, society, philosophy, and faith.

## About me:

Hi, my name is Paulo, I'm a man in his early 30's, hailing from the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Five years ago I decided to change career paths after being fired for programming VBA automations into my CRM workflows on company time - technically I spent lunch hours doing it - instead of taking customer calls.

I love slaving over excrutiatingly hard problems, but don't get me wrong. I'm not to say that I don't enjoy simple solutions. I fully subscribe to the DaVinci's statement that simplicity is the ultimate exponent of understanding. It's just that given the time and resources, I'm the kind of person that would rather reformulate an entire 20k line codebase from Numba compliant to Tensor compliant just because I found out that was the best standard for the job.
